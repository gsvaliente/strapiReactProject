## ABOUT THE PROJECT

This is a header of the page called Strapi. I took the challenge of replicating this header to practice CSS and React.

The website is created in a mobile first approach. Which means that the page was first created with how it would look in smaller devices. Then it was adapted to a medium size device, and to end in larger devices.

The main logic is stored in the css. In which elements are hidden and seen with the help of classes. This is were React comes to hand and conditionally apply classes depending on the state of said component.

To create a more dynamic look, in larger devices the navbar only has the page names, and when the mouse is over, the display the sublinks each page has. Transitions were applied to create a better flow.
